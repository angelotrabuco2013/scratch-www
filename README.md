### Build tag: 2.0.461.2_scratch-www_git_main_angelotrabuco2013_f04e4b26bed4450193199a146b1d14ed_122023

> [!WARNING]  
> Scratch Addons must be installed first. This makes the accurancy rate increase to 100%, although there are the following imperfections:
+ The 2.0 costumes &amp; sprites are no longer available.
+ The 3.0 costumes &amp; costumes are still included, which is not available in 2.0.
+ The blocks do not have any shadows, and the <q>when green flag clicked</q> block has the 3.0 flag.
+ When creating a new project, the <a href="https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Scratch_Cat">default Scratch Cat</a> no longer has the 2.0 style.
+ Some aspects of the editor, player &amp; website have the 3.0 ones for some reason.
+ The April Fool&apos;s languages <q>MEOW</q> and <q>Edible Scratch</q> are no longer available due to the translation system being unable to recognize joke languages.
+ The remix tree icon will not display correctly in the project page.
+ The sprites &amp; scripts count does not resemble the ones seen in the Scratch 2.0 project page.
+ The 2.0 fonts have been replaced with the 3.0 ones. Unfortunately, the Scratch (Black boys on mopeds) font got removed after the 3.0 update in 2019. This is because the MIT Media Lab was infringing copyrights between pizzadude, which was founded by Jakob Fischer and the creator of the <q>Black boys on mopeds</q> font, used for the Scratch logo and other stuff that use the font. The font was removed in 3.0 due to the previously mentioned reason, but it will still display correctly on Scratch projects created in versions prior to 3.0. PenguinMod brought back the font, albeit without using the <q>Black boys on mopeds</q> name to protect from copyright infringement. On January 2, 2018, myeducate on Scratch (<https://scratch.mit.edu>) contacted pizzadude about the situation, and Jakob responded that MIT purchased the rights to the aforementioned font (named Black boys on mopeds). But, if the Scratch font comes back in a future update, pizzadude (Jakob Fischer) would sue Scratch and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. However, the font can be downloaded <a href="https://www.dafont.com/black-boys-on-moped.font">here</a>. You can also extract the font's zip file to install the font. (This is needed for use on the web.)
+ The frontpage does not have the 2.0 stuff in the top of the page, such as the mascots, links, etc.

> [!NOTE]  
> This will make the style more accurate then usual, by using modified header links. from January 28, 2013 to 2014 (Scratch 3.0's official launch is on this date <q>January 2, 2019</q>) (Alpha development originally began in June 2012, but the alpha got replaced with the beta in December 2012).

## Description: 
(discontinued) Reverts 3.0 pages into 2.0! [alternative description: 2.0ified the 3.0 pages!]

All works made with Stylus&ast;.

&ast; Stylus had some bugs reported on its GitHub repository

> [!CAUTION]
> The project editor and frontpage will not display correctly on any Scratch mod based on TurboWarp (e.g. <a href="https://studio.penguinmod.com/editor.html">PenguinMod</a>, <a href="https://dinosaurmod.github.io/editor.html">DinosaurMod</a>, <a href="https://shredmod.is-an.app/editor.html">ShredMod</a>, etc.) Using Scratch is recommended, although it will slow down some large projects, such as projects containing 3D content, games, etc. Slowdowns decrease the FPS from 30 to 25-0. Extreme slowdowns (10-0 FPS) would cause the project to lag too much or crash the page.

> [!NOTE]  
> You need to get Stylus to install this userstyle. <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne">Get Stylus</a>

> [!TIP]
> If you wish to manually go to the Discuss page, visit <https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss>.

> [!WARNING]  
> Some pages already have a Scratch 2.0 style, however the search box is not shrunk to 170 pixels as smaller size, making it not resemble the ones seen in Scratch 2.0's old header (2013-2015).
